                    Whether it's rendering what might be, or injecting something completely new, <em>augmented reality</em> promises to
                    revolutionize our way of seeing and interacting with the world.

                    Augmented reality (abbreviated as <em>AR</em>) technologies take views of the real world (usually from a camera),
                    and augment them with additional computer-generated sensory data. For instance,
                    an AR smartphone app might display the view from the front camera and add virtual models to the real-world scene.

                    The most widespread applications of augmented reality today are built on top of smartphones;
                    these devices combine a number of useful sensors into a convenient handheld package: accelerometers,
                    gyroscopes, high-quality cameras, GPS units, and more are all commonly included in almost every
                    smartphone on the market. Furthermore, smartphones are also equipped with Internet connectivity and a number of user interaction
                    mechanisms, such as touchscreens, microphones, and speakers.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Almost all augmented reality applications rely on fast and powerful image processing.
                    This processing, known as <em>computer vision</em> (CV for short) allows applications to
                    correlate what is seen through the camera to real world geometry.

                    The algorithms and techniques of computer vision are not only used in augmented reality, however:
                    computer vision is also used in fields like automated quality control, robot navigation, and web search--
                    in short, any process that requires visual input or inspection can use computer vision.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Most augmented reality applications also require accurate methods of tracking user movement.
                    For personal-scale tracking, solid-state accelerometers and gyroscopes-- so-called microelectromechanical systems
                    (MEMS) devices-- are usually used to track user movement with 6 degrees of freedom.
                    On a larger scale, GPS tracking is usually used in conjuction with geotagging to add location-specific elements to the experience.

                    Games are, of course, among the most obvious applications of augmented reality.
                    Niantic Inc. conclusively proved that augmented reality gaming was viable with the release
                    of the hit AR game <em>Pokemon GO</em>, which became a global phenomenon almost overnight.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    Augmented reality displays have applications in the workplace as well:
                    heads-up displays containing status information, reference manuals, or other sensor data
                    could aid workers performing complex tasks.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    For example, surgeons could use AR technology to overlay patient records and vital signs onto
                    their real-life view of the patient-- avoiding the need for constant referencing and preventing possible mistakes.
                    Mechanics, likewise, could overlay digital repair manuals and diagrams onto their field of view to ease repairs.
                    Navigation software for automobiles and aircraft could overlay directions without the driver having to divert their attention from the view ahead.

                    Augmented reality games, such as <em>Pokemon GO</em>, have shed light on
                    practical issues concerning augmented reality; for example, there have been
                    countless instances of people failing to pay attention to their surroundings
                    while playing AR games. There have also been instances of people attempting to
                    play while driving, resulting in (sometimes fatal) accidents.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    The use of geotagging has also brought its own problems: some places
                    that have been "tagged" are simply inappropriate or are even dangerous
                    for certain AR activities. For example, <em>Pokemon GO</em> has (again) attracted
                    criticism due to players attempting to play the game in sites of worship, Holocaust memorials,
                    voting stations, restricted-entry areas, and so forth.

                    Despite its promise, augmented reality outside of research is still only in its infancy.
                    The necessary hardware for immersive augmented reality has only been commonplace for the past few years,
                    and software frameworks for actually harnessing augmented reality have only been developed very recently.
                </p>
                <p class="section-text">
                    However, as software and hardware developers gain more experience with augmented reality, the number of
                    applications for this exciting technology will only increase. Moreover, augmented reality will also
                    become more integrated with our social fabric and our culture. In the end, augmented reality will not
                    be a novelty, as it is today: it will be as normal to us as, say, social networking.
